This project involved building a reliable and performant emulator for the classic Nintendo Entertainment System, focusing on accuracy, efficiency, and maintainability using Rust.

## Responsibilities
- Implemented the NES CPU (6502) and memory management  
- Ensured accurate emulation through extensive cycle-by-cycle testing and debugging  
- Optimized performance using Rustâ€™s concurrency and memory-safe features  

## What I Learned
I deepened my understanding of low-level hardware behavior, Rust programming, and performance-critical software design. The project also provided practical experience with systems architecture, emulation techniques, and debugging complex software systems.
