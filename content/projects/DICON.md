This project involved creating a cross-platform application in Python (PySide/Qt) that continuously monitors, logs, and manages a hydrogen fuel cell system and associated high-voltage components.

## Responsibilities
- Built a GUI application for real-time data visualization and controls  
- Integrated protocol handling for the BrightLoop converters, MS-100 fuel cell, and 100 V battery  
- Implemented safety checks, diagnostics, and data logging for regulatory compliance  

## Learning Experience
I strengthened my Python and Qt skills for creating robust desktop applications, and I gained hands-on experience with hydrogen fuel cell systems. Additionally, I learned how to handle multi-device communication and maintain high standards of reliability in an aerospace context.
