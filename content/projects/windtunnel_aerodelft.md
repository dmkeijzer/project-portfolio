Created a monitoring solution used in wind tunnel tests for AeroDelft, measuring the performance and behavior of the radiators  under realistic aerodynamic conditions.

This project also had an embedded aspect in the form of an Arduino Giga interfacing with the sensor and sending packets of data to the runner which then displayed them.

## Responsibilities
- Designed a PySide-based Qt application (DICON) to visualize real-time sensor data  
- Integrated and controlled BrightLoop converters, MS-100 fuel cell system, and battery packs  
- Ensured data accuracy and system reliability during intensive aerodynamic testing

## What I Learned
I deepened my expertise in creating robust control interfaces, handling real-time data streams, and improved my skills in practical integration between software systems and experimental hardware setups.
