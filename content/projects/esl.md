Developed an embedded control unit for the Quadrupel drone, a tethered quad-rotor aerial vehicle, as part of the Embedded Systems Lab course at TU Delft. The project involved stabilizing the drone to hover and fly using limited user control via a single joystick. The original site with all instructions can be found [`here`](https://cese.ewi.tudelft.nl/embedded-systems-lab/).


The control algorithm was implemented on a custom PCB featuring a modern nRF System on Chip (SoC), interfacing with sensor modules and motor controllers. The programming language used for developing the control system was Rust.

## Responsibilities
- Implemented control algorithms in Rust for drone stabilization and maneuvering
- Integrated gyroscopes, accelerometers, and motor controllers with the nRF SoC
- Processed sensor data and developed signal processing routines for real-time control
- Conducted system testing and debugging to ensure reliable drone operation

## What I Learned
This project enhanced my proficiency in Rust programming and deepened my understanding of embedded systems design. I gained hands-on experience in integrating sensors and actuators, applying control theory, and processing real-time signals. Additionally, I learned to collaborate effectively within a multidisciplinary team to achieve complex system objectives.
