## Responsibilities
- Aided in the design of the wiring layout for signal and power distribution, ensuring minimal interference  
- Aided in assembling and crimping connectors, ensuring proper cable routing and strain relief  
- Performed continuity and insulation tests to verify system reliability  
- Functioned as guide for the intern implementing the wiring harness and creating documenation.

## What I Learned
I gained hands-on experience in low-voltage electrical design, connector selection, and harness fabrication. I also learned about mitigating electrical noise, ensuring proper grounding, and optimizing wiring layouts for aerospace applications. More importantly, I learned how to communicate design ideas and feeback to fellow team members.
