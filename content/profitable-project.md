This project focused on creating an embedded Vehicle Control Unit (VCU) that orchestrates critical operations among multiple powertrain components—such as hydrogen fuel cells, batteries, and motor controllers—in a light aircraft.

## Responsibilities
- Wrote C firmware to coordinate high-voltage power path control and sensor monitoring  
- Integrated safety and diagnostic routines, including fault detection and system fallback modes  
- Ensured software compliance with DO-178C requirements through rigorous testing and documentation  

## What I Learned
I expanded my skills in embedded real-time control, safety-critical software development, and collaboration with regulatory authorities. This project also strengthened my understanding of hydrogen-based propulsion systems in aerospace applications.
