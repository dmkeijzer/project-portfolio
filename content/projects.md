Welcome to my projects portfolio, where you’ll find a collection of the work I’ve done across software development, embedded systems, and control engineering. Rather than categorizing by industry, projects are grouped based on their origins, so whether it was my student team year, personal or educational reasons. Whether it’s developing robust embedded software, designing real-time control systems, or optimizing high-performance applications, each project showcases my approach to building reliable and efficient solutions.
