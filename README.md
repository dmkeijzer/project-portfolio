# Project Portfolio Theme


Build and test this portofolio using `zola serve` and `zola build`.


## Troubleshooting

- Make sure the base URL is correct when using this template, otherwise the CSS will not work and the formatting will be off. 
- Figures in the markdown text should start with from the static path. You do not have to add /static to the path specifying the image.


## Building process

- To build the site simply push to the main branch and a github action will deploy the site to the github pages. You can manually trigger it as well from Githbu
